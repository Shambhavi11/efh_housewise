===========
1. the arduino IDE was not compiling for the edison board. i used the board manager to install the intel edison i686 dev kit but got some errors. said the post install scripts failed. so chnaged the +111 to /111 as per this thread https://communities.intel.com/thread/48053 and the sdk install seemed to complete.
